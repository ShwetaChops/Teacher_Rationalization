# Teacher_Rationalization

This was my first attempt at programming, before a formal education in the subject.

This is a Teacher Redistribution Algorithm that attempts to optimally match teachers from schools with a surplus, to schools with a deficit, while minizing geographical diplacement, and ensuring a match on other necessary parameters like medium of instruction and annual schooling cycle. The goal is to reduce the count of schools handled by a single-teacher, and to minimize the pupil teacher ratio.
